This is the code for a Parametric UMAP model saved as an ONNX file. The model takes 32 dimension vectors
and transforms them to 2 dimenson vectors. 
Currently the model is the MARK I, it has only been trained with a dummy dataset and not with real data, 
consequently it should not be taken seriously.
